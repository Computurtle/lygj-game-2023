mayor-layla: "Oh, bless you, adventurer!" "You've done it! You've saved us all!" "The well's sprouting water like it's a spring morning." "Look around you, look at the joy on their faces." "The town's folk, they're healthy, the kids are playing around, and the fields are getting watered again." "We couldn't have survived without you." "You're a true hero, even if you did it for nothing." "Thank you."
